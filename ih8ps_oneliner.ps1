# I hate PowerShell Service Enumerator
# (C) Macarthur Inbody AGPLv3 2020
# This script will enumerate through services finding one where you have
# the ability to start it and also are able to change where the image is stored.
# Not a great script. But it works.
# Basically it's looking for services where the listed user is in the ACL, that they have full control.
# It's also making sure we have the ability to modify things.
# The one thing it doesn't do is modify the registry settings.

#make sure to set $user at the front of the script to the user you want to target.
