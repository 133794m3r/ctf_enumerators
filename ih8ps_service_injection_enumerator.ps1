# I hate PowerShell Service Enumerator
# (C) Macarthur Inbody AGPLv3 2020
# The primary purpose of this script is to find all services where you're able 
# to modify it to do DLL injection and the service you're attacking is run as 
#SYSTEM user. Further it'll make sure that your user is able to do this.
# It'll give you a list of all of the possible services at the end reducing
# your search space.
# Basically it's looking for services where the listed user is in the ACL, that they have full control.
# It's also making sure we have the ability to modify things.
# The one thing it doesn't do is modify the registry settings.

1)This line takes all items from the services hive, 
2) formats it to a list. 
3) Then it looks for the string HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
4) then finds the strings that have "Name " in their line
5) Then it Enumerates over each item splitting the string by the ":". 
6) Then I remove the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE prefix.
7) Then it sets the value to be the variable $services.
